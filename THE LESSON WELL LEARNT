                          THE LESSON WELL LEARNT

Don't exaggerate the meaning of someone else words and think they are showing keen interest. They might mean something but in very puny amount. 
Restrain your mind from harbouring unintended feelings of others  and getting hanged itself in gallows.

Consider the present circumstances to be motivation and a harshest mental test to pass.

Can't you see how ignorant she is. And look at the hope you are still carring deep inside despite being seeing her ignorant behaviour. Develop the intelligence to read people words with tone and expressions. They speak a lot but you are blind and deaf because of  hope.

Encompass your mind with other things everytime. Write a lot as it seems to be a great reliever in these time and ever. Writing is developing into a substance I can entrust for relieving me in my bad times and exaggerating my happiness in good times. Though , I haven't tried writing in good time but I can project it to be adding to my elations.  

When she talks with such high level of involvement with Fatherly Figure and likes , might be that gesture of her is the reason I still carry hope. But the understanding of leaving her is very explicit in my mind and the dire consequences if failed to do so.

I've already been through this unwanted phase so, how can my experienced mind allow me to get into this again. This should be answered with succinct explation to avoid any such future mishaps. I don't want others consultation in this matter rather I should handle the frustration is a very smart way. Some tricks I've adopted since few days and they seems to works in positive way but still that undying puny hope has to be eradicated by some other means soon.
