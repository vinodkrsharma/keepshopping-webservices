2.0	Introduction
2.1	Overview
With the successful rollout of BDP to AAA, BSA, IRA, Managed, Business and Personal Trust accounts, ERISA, PWM/GIM II, NRA (Selected Accounts) and BSA accounts without a sweep option will also now be eligible to select BDP as their sweep vehicle.  
BDP will be replacing current sweep funds SGMT (US Government Money Market Trust) and ILAF (Liquid Asset Fund), AAMT and AAGS for eligible accounts, while tax-free funds CTFI, NTFI, ITFI, AATF, AACT, AAIG, and AANY will still be available as fund choices for pertinent accounts. 
Please note that the regulatory deposit limits for IRA accounts are different than for BSA and AAA accounts.  For all IRA accounts except Coverdell ESA accounts, Metavante should sweep the first 245k to Bank 1, the next 245k to Bank 2, and anything beyond 490k back to Bank 1.  Morgan Stanley has nothing to do with these deposit limits, which are determined via a parameter within the Metavante system.  As such, Metavante will need to change the parameter for the new product codes.
2.2	Definitions/Terms:
•	ERISA: (Employment Retirement Income Security Act) is a federal law that establishes legal guidelines for private pensions and employee benefit plans/trust (EBT). ERISA accounts at Morgan Stanley GWMG are comprised of:
o	Private pension accounts with IRA code of 200 series and 300 series. There is a 400 series being developed as this specification is being written.
o	EBT accounts - This is identified through class/subclass combination of 9Y (with or without IRA codes) and 9R (with no IRA codes). Please see section 3.4 for account eligibility details.


2.3	High-level rules for BDP phase 5:
•	Drain/fill and migration for GIM II/PWM, NRA and ERISA accounts. Eligible drain funds for this phase are AAMT, AAGS, ILAF and SGMT only.
•	Drain and fill is not applicable for BSA accounts without a sweep option. These accounts will be migrated into BDP. Further, any BSA accounts that were mailed and migrated from prior phases that opted out of BDP thereafter, are in scope. (Mailing and migration only)
•	For ERISA accounts only, weekly interest re-tiering will be performed based off the Plan level assets and not household assets.
Description	Class	Subclass	IRA Code	Account type eligible	Eligible for BDP 5 (Y/N)
EBT	9	R	200 series,
300 series
No IRA Code	AAA, BSA, IRA	Y
VIP and RPM	Z		200 series,
300 series	IRA	Y
EBT	9	Y	200 series,
300 series,
No IRA Code	AAA, IRA, BSA	Y
•	For the purposes of this project, ERISAs will be identified using class, subclass and IRA code.

•	Class/Subclass = 9/Blank. These will be treated as NON ERISA Accounts.
Class	Subclass	IRA Code	Account type eligible	Eligible for BDP 5 (Y/N)
9	Blanks	May or may not contain have an IRA code	AAA, IRA, BSA	Y
Comments:
There are 1600+ accounts that are currently active in CPS system. Per retirement business, approximately 450 of these accounts are ERISA accounts.
•	450 accounts identified as ERISA will be excluded from Mailing and Migration using the ‘do not migrate’ list. 
•	The remaining 1150+ accounts will be treated as NON-ERISA Accounts.
•	Post migration, any account opened with a ‘9’ class and ‘blank’ subclass will be considered NON-ERISA account and fit into one of the existing product codes at MV.

* Please note any new Class/Subclass being added after the launch date must be notified by the business.
•	NRA accounts (existing and to-be-opened) are eligible for BDP phase 5. 
o	NRA accounts are defined where NRA-Indicator in CPS/Merlin = ‘Y’
o	NRA accounts of type ERISA and IRA will not participate in this phase (includes Mailing, Migration and new to-be-opened accounts in CPS and Merlin)
o	Block AAMT, AAGS, ILAF and SGMT across all eligible accounts where NRA-Indicator = ‘Y’. 
o	Enable BDP as the default fund sweep choice to all eligible accounts where NRA-Indicator = ‘Y’. 
o	Post launch, NRA accounts will have eligible tax free funds and SICAV as alternate fund sweep choices. BDP will be the default fund choice for NRA accounts.

•	GWM accounts in PWM Offices are identified as follows:
190 - Philadelphia
191 - Boston
194 - Atlanta
279 - Los Angeles
284 - Washington DC
290 - Miami
580 - Hong Kong
590 - Latin America
690 - New York
691 - Chicago
692 - Houston
696 - San Francisco
790 – Zurich
699  (Old PWM Los Angeles number - closed)
289  (Old PWM Dallas number - closed)
195  (Old PWM Miami number - closed)
180  (Old PWM Seattle number - closed)
300  (PWM Invesment group - still open - but no activity)
700  (Open Retail branch located in Covington Louisiana


•	GIMII accounts:
o	Any account with a GIMII-Indicator of ‘Y’ is a GIMII account. These include accounts outside of PWM office range.
•	BSA accounts without sweep:
o	Current fund sweep choice = Space
o	Div Pay Opt Code = 0,1,2
•	Personal Trust accounts are not eligible for BDP Phase 5 (Mailing and migration) No changes to CPS/Merlin are required for this phase. Personal Trust offices are: 755, 534, 546, 558, 566, 568 and 583. 
•	Guaranteed interest rates for all Phase 5 accounts (excluding BSA accounts w/o sweep) for the first 6 months from the launch date.
•	TWO new product codes to be opened at Metavante to facilitate this launch.
o	Product Code 016 – for all ERISA Non Managed (AAA, BSA, IRA) accounts
o	Product Code 017 – for all ERISA Managed (AAA, BSA, IRA) accounts 
•	For the purposes of product codes assignment, the following hierarchy will apply:
o	ERISA
o	PWM/GIMII/NRA/BSA without sweep – must follow the current processing
o	As an example, a non managed GIMII account of type ERISA must be treated as an ERISA account and must be assigned product code 016.
•	AAA Maintenance to ignore any account upgrades (from BSA to AAA) or downgrades (from AAA to BSA) for product codes 016 and 017 in the weekly maintenance process to Metavante. Other maintenance activities must be captured and reported appropriately to Metavante. 
•	Morgan Stanley and Metavante to utilize existing product codes (001 through 014) for PWM/GIM II, NRA and BSA accounts without sweep. As an example, a non-managed AAA NRA account will be migrated to product code 001 and will be provided guaranteed rates.
•	There is a special requirement for EDB to warehouse the guaranteed rates at individual accounts level within an existing product code. This will be accomplished via the tier override mechanism in the EDB tables.
•	ERISA and GIM2 Access accounts incepted on or before August 31, 2003 will not participate in  drain/fill scenario. Any ERISA and GIM2 Access account incepted after August 31, 2003 are eligible for BDP phase 5 and will participate in the migration process.
•	ERISA and GIM2 Vision accounts incepted before September 17, 2007 will not participate in the drain/fill scenario. Any ERISA and GIM2 Vision account incepted on or after September 17, 2007 are eligible for BDP phase 5 and will participate in the migration process.
•	Specific accounts may be exempt from participating in BDP. This list will be provided by the Business.
•	All existing Multi-Bank (Morgan Stanley Bank and Morgan Stanley Trust) functionality will apply to AAA, BSA and IRA BDP sweep balances. The FDIC limits on ERISA accounts stand at $250,000.

2.4	Dependencies:
•	This project is dependent on the availability of the Retirement systems (Plan Admin Database project) to support the interest re-tier process. Plan Admin project is currently in flight and is expected to be launched around end of 2nd calendar quarter 2008. Major systems involved to develop the plan admin database are CPS/Merlin, Data Modelling group, Data Services.

3.6	NRA Accounts
3.6.1	Rules for NRA accounts


•	Offer BDP as the default fund choice to all accounts where NRA-Indicator = ‘Y’. 

•	Eligible tax free funds and SICAV fund will be  alternate fund sweep choices for NRA accounts.

•	ILAF will be the default fund sweep choice for any IRA account (managed, non-managed) where NRA Indicator in CPS/Merlin = ‘Y’. NRA accounts of type ERISA or IRA are out of scope for this phase. This point is just a restatement of the current functionality in production.

•	Block AAMT, AAGS, ILAF and SGMT as valid fund sweep choice for eligible accounts where NRA Indicator in CPS/Merlin = ‘Y’. 

•	Leave SICAV (IUSD) fund untouched in production.

3.6.2	Use cases for NRA accounts

The use cases will be published in a separate document.

3.7	PWM/GIM II Accounts
PWM accounts and GIM II accounts are in scope for this phase. Please see section 2.3 for details.
3.8	Systems Impacted by eligibility requirements.
Eligibility rules are implemented in CPS and Merlin.  The screens used for the following functions must undergo edits revision to allow the accounts described above to elect BDP as their sweep choice.  Specific screens used in the various affected work flows are detailed in the work flow sections of this document.

Managed platform inception and trading systems also have eligibility logic that must be revised to accommodate these new account types.  The relevant systems are:
Advisor One
Custom Portfolio
Access
PPA
FS/PA
NDA.
The affected functions are detailed in the work flow section of this document.


4.0	Migration
4.1	Overview
Effective on migration date there are a number of changes that will need to be in place as described in this section.  Please note that unless otherwise specified, the migration details below apply only to ERISA, GIM II accounts (Managed, Business and Personal Trust (AAA, BSA, IRA)) and BSA accounts without a sweep option.
4.2	Development/Deliverables
•	The migration date for all Phase 5 accounts including BSA without sweep will be 5/16/2008. 
•	Vision accounts incepted before September 17, 2007 will not participate in the drain/fill scenario. Any ERISA and GIM2 Vision account incepted on or after September 17, 2007 are eligible for BDP phase 5 and will participate in the migration process. 
•	Access accounts incepted on or before August 31, 2003 will not participate in the drain/fill scenario. These accounts must not be migrated. Alternatively, any Access account opened after August 31, 2003 will be subject to drain/fill concept and will participate in migration.  
•	Managed CESA accounts will be subject to Mailing and Migration during this phase. Systematic edits in CPS and Merlin are already in place and does not require any code change.
•	For eligible AAA accounts that have AAMT or AAGS as their sweep vehicle prior to migration date, AAMT/AAGS becomes the previous fund choices and BDPS becomes the current fund choice. 
•	For eligible BSA accounts that have ILAF or SGMT selected as their sweep vehicle prior to migration date, ILAF/SGMT becomes the previous fund choices and BDPS becomes the current fund choice.  As all eligible IRA accounts have ILAF as their sweep vehicle, ILAF will become the previous fund choice and BDPS becomes the current fund choice.
•	For BSA accounts with no sweep option, BDPS will become the fund choice and these are not subject to drain/fill concept.
•	On the CPS A page, the history field should show AAMT or AAGS, respectively, as the prior sweep fund choice as of migration date for AAA accounts.
•	On the CPS U page and R page, the history field should show ILAF or SGMT, respectively, as the prior sweep fund choice as of migration date for both BSA and IRA accounts.
•	On CPS, ‘BDPS’ will be the choice for accounts that migrate to BDP, and ‘BDPS’ should be allowed to be entered for new eligible AAA accounts on the A screen.
•	On CPS, ‘BDPS’ will be the choice for accounts that migrate to BDP, and ‘BDPS’ should be allowed to be entered for new eligible BSA accounts on the Universal fund selection screen and on the G2 screen for IRA accounts.
•	On the Merlin AAA fund choice screen, the Add fund drop down selection box should list ‘BDPS’ to represent the BDP program for eligible BDPS accounts. BDPS should be the first fund listed.
•	On the Merlin Universal Sweep Fund Choice screen, the Add fund drop down selection box should list ‘BDPS’ to represent the BDP program for eligible BSA accounts.  BDPS should be the first fund listed.
•	All eligible BSA accounts will not be allowed to manually purchase ILAF or SGMT. This is restatement of the current functionality in production and does not require any code change.
•	All eligible IRA accounts will not be allowed to manually purchase ILAF. This is restatement of the current functionality in production and does not require any code change.
•	BDP eligible IRA accounts will continue to be able to manually purchase SGMT as part of their IRA portfolio.  IRA accounts ineligible for BDP will continue to have ILAF as their sweep vehicle and will continue to be able to purchase SGMT.  This is a re-statement of the functionality currently in place, and does not represent new functionality.

5.0	Sweep and Maintenance Process
5.1	Overview
During the drain and fill process, the drain on eligible accounts will be carried out by Universal Sweep (for BSA and IRA accounts) and AAA sweep (for AAA accounts), the fill will be carried out by BDP sweep.  Once the drain balance is depleted, eligible accounts that have migrated to BDPS or fund-switch into BDPS will have their BDP sweep debits and credits exercised wholly by the BDP sweep.  
There are no drain and fill processing changes for the following accounts:
•	AAA accounts ineligible for BDP that maintain AAMT or AAGS as their sweep choice.
•	BSA or IRA accounts ineligible for BDP that maintain ILAF or SGMT as their sweep choice.
•	AAA accounts that have AATF, AACT, AAIG, AAIF or AANY selected as their sweep vehicle.
•	BSA accounts that have CTFI, ITFI, or NTFI selected as their sweep vehicle.
5.2	Pre-conditions
The drain/fill logic is applicable only for ERISA, PWM/GIM2 and NRA accounts (Managed and Non Managed). Other money market funds are listed here for reference.

5.3	Sweep Process 
The following outlines the sweep process for AAA, BSA and IRA accounts. As such, all the functionalities depicted below are in production. The following is for reference purposes.
 
Sweep process consists of the following 3 types of sweep.
5.3.1	Universal Sweep
Universal Sweep is responsible for sweeping funds for BSA, IRA accounts. This process must be enhanced to include ERISA, PWM, NRA and GIM2 accounts (Managed and Non managed) BSA, IRA accounts for BDP Phase 5.
There is no work required to handle BDP accounts without a sweep option.
1.	Sweep Frequency
For BSA accounts, sweep should take place daily if there is a cash balance > $999.99.  If the cash balance < = $999.99, sweep weekly on Monday nights.
Currently, for IRA accounts, sweep takes place daily if there is a cash balance > $0.00.  This will continue to be the case when the sweep choice is BDP.
Note that the sweep frequency will not change for those accounts that have one of the BSA tax free funds as their sweep vehicle, nor will it change for BSA accounts that are ineligible for BDP.
5.3.2	BDP Sweep
BDP sweep is responsible for sweeping funds into and out of BDP fund for BSA, IRA and AAA accounts. This process must be enhanced to accommodate sweep for:
 ERISA (including EBT), PWM, NRA and GIM2 Managed and Non Managed BSA, IRA, AAA accounts.
5.3.3	AAA Sweep
AAA sweep is responsible for sweeping funds into and out of AAA funds for AAA accounts. There will be no change in the sweep frequency for AAA accounts, i.e. sweep takes place daily if there is a cash balance > $0.00
5.3.4	Development and Deliverables
Enhance Universal, BDP and AAA sweep to recognize and sweep funds appropriately for ERISA, NRA, PWM and GIM2 accounts. ERISA and GIM2 can be of account type BSA, IRA or AAA and may be managed or non-managed. The following grid summarizes the account types and its relation to specific product codes at Metavante.

Feature	Account Types	Product codes 	Identification for Sweep	Comments
ERISA/EBT	AAA, BSA, IRA
(Managed or Non managed)	016, 017 (new product codes)	Class, Subclass, IRA code	In terms of product code assignment, ERISA will hold priority.
GIM2/NRA/PWM	AAA, BSA, IRA
(Managed or Non managed)	001 through 014 (all existing product codes	Use the current identification process to assign product codes.	
BSA accounts without sweep option	BSA	Existing product codes	Use the current identification process to assign product codes.	These accounts should automatically sweep into the existing process. No new build is required


•	AAA, BSA and IRA Tier Maintenance API needs to be updated to account for new product numbers.
•	The new product codes will need to be provided to MV on the Maintenance and Daily Activity file.
•	For this phase, the drain/fill scenario for eligible AAA, BSA, IRA accounts will be identified when BDP is the current fund choice and current fund date = 5/16/08 (in production) and the prior fund choice is AAMT, AAGS, ILAF or SGMT. Drain/fill dates from prior phases will continue to function as is.
o	Phase 4 = 9/14/07 (for all Phase 4 accounts except NDA)
o	Phase 4 = 9/17/07 (for eligible  NDA accounts)
o	Phase 3 = 9/15/06
o	Phase 1 = 11/18/05

5.4	Maintenance Process
Maintenance process currently runs at 5 am every business day. The purpose of maintenance process is to recognize changes involved in account maintenance (such as account closure, account upgrade/downgrade) and transmit the information to Metavante deposits system for processing.
5.4.1	Existing maintenance process
Maintenance process consists of:
1.	Account opening at Metavante – This is done when current fund choice is BDP and the plan number is blank. The logic used for account opening at Metavante will function exactly in a similar manner as it does for AAA, BSA and IRA accounts currently in production. Account opening is based on information from CPS.  
Notes:  
•	Once an account is opened, AAA provides a file to CPS that includes the plan number.
•	Metavante will continue to receive the daily activity and maintenance files, represented by appropriate product codes as outlined in Section 6.2
2.	Account closing and re-opening at Metavante – This is done when an account switches out of BDP as the current fund choice into another non-BDP fund choice. This constitutes a full-sell of all BDP holdings and posting accrued interest to the account. This constitutes an account closure at Metavante. The existing rules for account closing and reopening at Metavante will follow the current process as it exists in production
3.	Swung accounts – When accounts swing from one office to another, necessary maintenance (close ‘swing from’ account and open ‘swing to’ account) records are sent to Metavante.
4.	Other Maintenance activities – such as single to joint ownership, FA number change, Product code change, interest tier change are also handled appropriately.
5.	The concepts explained below already exist in production and must be extended to Phase 5 managed accounts.
The business case – There should be no change in BDP rates and/or should not full-sell/buy back when a client changes from one managed product to another (such as Custom Portfolio to PPA).
Current process – A shift from one managed product to another entails a step down from Managed (custom portfolio) to non-managed status (trade control = 0 in CPS). The account is then upgraded to PPA.
The Challenge – A client’s intention to terminate a managed account permanently versus shifting to another managed product cannot be deciphered systematically as both these cases 	involve switching the account to non-managed status.
The solution – It has been decided that every client terminating the managed status will be assured the guaranteed 100% rate (AAMT or ILAF, depending on the account type) for 8 days from the termination date. If within 8 days, the client indeed shifts to another managed product, there will be no impact to his/her BDP positions i.e. (there will be no interest rate re-tier, no full-sell and no product code change). However, if after 8 days, the client still continues to be in a non-managed status, maintenance process will request (a) product code change, (b) interest rate change.
The logical design to implement the same is outlined below. Detailed technical specification is required to accomplish this task:
 

5.4.2	Enhancement required/Development/Deliverables
•	The Account Maintenance File sent to Metavante must handle more product codes as outlined in section 7.2.
•	Extend the concept of “Warehousing” to Phase 5 managed accounts. The concepts explained below already exist in production and must be extended to Phase 5 managed accounts.
•	Maintenance to account for various use cases for Phase 5 accounts. Please refer to the Use Case document attached in Appendix A (last page of the document).
5.5	Margins Bucketing
The Margins bucketing in support of this phase will be exactly the same as the bucketing used to support AAA, BSA/IRA drain and fill sweep processing
6.0	Tier Maintenance
6.1	Overview
ERISA/EBT and GIM2 (of account types AAA, BSA and IRA) accounts that select BDP as their sweep choice will get an interest rate based on the managed or non-managed status.
This table represents the expected tiers that are required to support ERISA/EBT and GIM2 accounts.  
6.2	Product Codes at Metavante
New product codes should be setup on Metavante to support bank deposits for ERISA/EBT accounts. GIM2 accounts and BSA accounts without a sweep option will use the existing product codes set up at Metavante.
  


Metavante Index Rate Number	Index Rate DESCRIPTION	Auto or Manual entry
001	$0 - $99,999	M
002	$500,000 - $999,999	M

012	$100,000 – $249,999	M
013	$250,000 -  $499,999	M
100	Fed Fund Rate	A

* Note that the rates for tiers 005 and 006 will be entered systematically using a daily process.  Therefore these two tiers will not utilize the weekly manual entry process

Note that interest plan 180 through 189 will be reserved for up to 10 unique override rates for special situations. Interest Plan 180 is currently in use for a small group of accounts.

16.0	Data Services, Mutual Funds, Sweep Requirements for Tier Maintenance
16.1	Overview:
ERISA/EBT accounts that select BDP as their sweep choice will get an interest rate based on the plan level assets, not household assets.
This table represents the expected tiers that are required to support ERISA accounts. 

16.2	Development/Deliverables:
#	Deliverables	Systems Impacted
1	ERISA/EBT accounts will receive interest rate corresponding to the assets held under the plan. There will be new product codes set up to determine the tier. Product codes are 016(Non managed ERISA) and 017 (Managed ERISA). Please see section 4.0 for details.	Data Services
Sweep
2	The interest retiering at plan assets level is dependent on the completion and availability of plan admin database project. An output of the plan admin database project is the creation of the plan level assets	Data Services, Data Modelling
3	Existing ERISA/GIM2/PWM/NRA non managed accounts to receive 90% of prior MMF for at least 6 months with tiered rates thereafter.	Data Services
Sweep
4	New ERISA plans (opened after launch date) to receive the tiered rate starting when the account is opened. New ERISA accounts under existing plan (migrated plan) will receive guaranteed rates for the first 6 months from launch date.	
5	Guaranteed interest rates will be set using the same weekly process as in prior phases
	Data Services
6	Tiered interest rates will be set weekly, using the same process as in prior phases. 	Data Services
7	New and existing Managed ERISA/EBT accounts will receive the 100% ILAF rate in perpetuity regardless of the account type (AAA,  BSA or IRA)	Data Services
8	Similar to managed accounts, the 100% AAMT and 100% ILAF rate should be set daily to be equal to the prior day’s AAMT/ILAF daily yield.  This should be done systematically and not require rates to be entered manually.	Mutual Funds
9	Inactive accounts (accounts no longer in BDP) must be purged from the EDB tables that is used for interest retier purposes	Data Services

17.0	PWM/GIM 2 Accounts

Currently, Data Services transmits a daily feed consisting of transactions, positions of all GIM2 accounts to PWM.

17.1	Development/Deliverables:
This daily feed to PWM must be enhanced to send BDP related transactions and positions to PWM.
In addition to the existing feed, GWM will also send a copy of the bank balance table consisting of PWM/GIM2 accounts (received from Metavante) to PWM systems.
APY by tier file will be transmitted from GWM to PWM daily.
18.0	Margins

All processes to support BDP Phase 5 in terms of Journals, Bucket movements to track BDP numbers must continue to function as in prior phases.

18.1	Development/Deliverables:
None

19.0	Performance Reporting
Performance Reporting produces monthly and quarterly reports for ERISA managed accounts. All underlying BDP security positions are rolled into the 360 security on RTA. 


19.1	Development/Deliverables:
1. Interest for BDP securities flow in on transactions for 361, 364, 368 securities. Tests for the security identifiers are hard coded, so as securities are added changes need to be made. 

		2. Change Quarterly Performance Reports, PAD Report .

20.0	Open Items

1.	ERISA and GIM 2 accounts can take the shape of a managed account; especially Vision and Access – In Phase 4, all Vision accounts incepted up to September 17, 2007 were excluded from BDP. Should we continue to exclude ERISA Vision accounts and GIM2 Vision accounts opened prior to 9/17/07? – YES. Issue Closed.

2.	In Phase 4, all Access accounts incepted prior to August 31, 2003 were excluded from BDP. Should we continue to exclude ERISA Access accounts and GIM2 Vision accounts incepted prior to 8/31/03? – YES. Issue Closed.


3.	Accounts with class 9, subclass blank (BSA accounts) – Business is determining to validity of these accounts. – There are about 1600+ accounts – How to treat them? – Only 450 are ERISA accounts, which will be excluded from mailing and migration using the ‘do not’ migrate mechanism. All the other accounts will be treated as NON-ERISA accounts. Post launch, 9 blank accounts are considered Non-ERISA accounts.

4.	BSA accounts without sweep that had BDP in the past – This is included in the scope. We will be mailing and migrating these accounts.

5.	Do we require two dates (one for BSA accounts without sweep and the other for all other accounts) for migration for this phase 5? –Not required, AAA will be able to handle all the target accounts with just one date. 5/16/08

6.	Accounts with class 9 subclass Y (AAA accounts) – There are about 9,965 accounts – How to treat them? – Business has confirmed these will be treated as ERISA accounts.

7.	BSA Accounts without a sweep option – Included in this pile are ERISA accounts that are of account type BSA without a sweep choice – How do we treat these? Should these be put into BDP through migration with no drain/fill or should these accounts be treated under the ERISA umbrella? –  (1) A plain BSA account w/o sweep should be migrated into BDP and will be paid interest according to regular tiers. (2) An ERISA BSA account w/o sweep must also be migrated into BDP and will be paid interest according to guaranteed tiers for the first 6 months.

8.	GIM2 accounts – Is there such a thing as GIM 2 Business or BusinessScape account? – Yes, BusinessScape accounts are out of scope.

9.	Confirm Statement format for ERISA and EBT accounts.

10.	With the functionality of universal sweep indicator changing for BSA accounts, how do we close BSA accounts in CPS? – this requirement is no longer applicable. We are not changing the behavior of u sweep indicator in cps/merlin

11.	New requirement – For BSA w/o sweep accounts that will be migrated on May 17, CPS must have the ability to retain these accounts without a sweep if the client decides to do so post migration. Alternatively, any new BSA account opened/changed post May 19, 08 cannot be without a sweep. – How do we handle this? – no longer applicable

12.	SICAV fund – SICAV (IUSD) fund must be blocked as a valid sweep choice beginning May 19, 2008 for all NRA accounts in the following 18 countries  - This request no longer applicable
