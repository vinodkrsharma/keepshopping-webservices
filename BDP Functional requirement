2.0	Introduction
2.1	Overview
With the successful rollout of BDP to AAA accounts, BSA and IRA accounts, Managed Accounts, Business Accounts and Personal Trust accounts will also now be eligible to select BDP as their sweep vehicle.  BDP will be replacing current sweep funds SGMT (US Government Money Market Trust) and ILAF (Liquid Asset Fund), AAMT and AAGS for eligible accounts, while tax-free funds CTFI, NTFI, ITFI, AATF, AACT, AAIG, AAIG, New York Tax Free (not available as of now) will still be available as fund choices for all Managed BSA and AAA accounts respectively. The following table outlines all the details pertaining to the available sweep choices.
Please note that the regulatory deposit limits for IRA accounts are different than for BSA and AAA accounts.  For all IRA accounts except Coverdell ESA accounts, Metavante should sweep the first 245k to Bank 1, the next 245k to Bank 2, and anything beyond 490k back to Bank 1.  Morgan Stanley has nothing to do with these deposit limits, which are determined via a parameter within the Metavante system.  As such, Metavante will need to change the parameter for the new product codes.

2.2	High-level rules for BDP phase 4:
•	Business Scape Accounts are not eligible for BDP phase 4.
•	All Personal Trust accounts (managed and non-managed) will receive interest rates meant for managed accounts. (Personal Trust AAA accounts will receive 100% AAMT rate into perpetuity and Personal Trust BSA/IRA accounts will receive 100% ILAF rate into perpetuity)
•	NDA accounts are managed accounts and will be subject to BDP drain/fill migration and are included in the scope for BDP phase 4.
•	NRA accounts (existing and to-be-opened) are not eligible for BDP phase 4.
•	PWM accounts are not eligible for BDP phase 4.
•	Access accounts incepted on or before August 31, 2003 will not participate in the drain/fill scenario. Any account opened after August 31, 2003 are eligible for BDP phase 4 and will participate in the migration process.
•	Vision accounts are exempt from BDP migration process. Vision accounts opened after BDP launch date will be allowed to have BDPS as the fund choice.
•	Access accounts incepted on or before August 31, 2003 will not participate in drain/fill scenario. 
•	Specific accounts may be exempt from participating in BDP. This list will be provided by the Business.

 
 


Notes:
•	All existing Multi-Bank (Morgan Stanley Bank and Morgan Stanley Trust FSB) functionality will apply to AAA, BSA and IRA BDP sweep balances.
2.3	Scope
This document includes the functional specifications for allowing eligible AAA, BSA and IRA accounts to select BDPS as their sweep vehicle, processing related to the new fund choice, and the impact to downstream applications of the new fund sweep option.

•	Changes to reports produced by the Data Warehouse.  These requirements are documented under separate cover.
•	Client Mailing – The client mailing strategy will be dealt with in a separate document.
2.5	Assumptions

4.0	Account Eligibility 
4.1	Overview
Managed account eligibility for participation in BDP is determined by many pieces of information on CPS.  All the account parameters below need to be satisfied for an account to participate in BDP.  Any ineligible accounts should be systemically blocked from participating in BDP.
Account type should be the initial check for eligibility, followed by Dividend Pay Code, Registration, Account Status and jurisdiction for foreign accounts.  Specific indicators, like the Novis indicator for collateral account should be the final check made.

4.6	International Accounts
4.6.1	Existing Accounts
Offshore clients/Non-Resident Aliens (NRA) with accounts currently sweep to a Migration Eligible Sweep Fund will be notified of BDP but will NOT be migrated to the Bank Deposit Program.  These client accounts will continue to sweep to their current sweep fund.
4.6.2	New Accounts
All new NRA accounts will be blocked from selecting BDP. 
4.7	PWM Accounts
PWM accounts that are on the GWM platform are NOT eligible to participate in BDP. CPS should block BDP for all PWM offices in GWM platform.
4.8	Collateral Accounts 
Collateral accounts identified with Trade Control = S (for Legacy Accounts) or Novis Indicator = C (for Newer Accounts) are eligible to participate in BDP.
4.9	Systems Impacted by eligibility requirements.
Eligibility rules are implemented in CPS and Merlin.  The screens used for the following functions must undergo edits revision to allow the accounts described above to elect BDP as their sweep choice.  Specific screens used in the various affected work flows are detailed in the work flow sections of this document.

Managed platform inception and trading systems also have eligibility logic that must be revised to accommodate these new account types.  The relevant systems are:
Advisor One
Custom Portfolio
Access
PPA
FS/PA
NDA.

The affected functions are detailed in the work flow section of this document.


5.0	Migration
5.1	Overview
Effective on migration date there are a number of changes that will need to be in place as described in this section.  Please note that unless otherwise specified, the migration details below apply only to Managed, Business and Personal Trust (AAA, BSA, IRA) accounts.
5.2	Development/Deliverables
•	Vision accounts are EXEMPT from drain/fill scenarios. These accounts must not be migrated. Any Vision account opened on or after BDP launch date should allow BDPS as the default fund choice.  Any Vision account incepted prior to the launch date must be permitted to keep their existing sweep fund.  They may also choose to elect BDP, but in that case will not be a drain-fill account but will behave like any newly opened Vision account.
•	Access accounts incepted on or before August 31, 2003 will not participate in the drain/fill scenario. These accounts must not be migrated. Alternatively, any Access account opened after August 31, 2003 will be subject to drain/fill concept and will participate in migration.  These accounts will be specifically listed in an exclusion file read by the migration process on the go-live weekend.
•	For eligible AAA accounts that have AAMT or AAGS as their sweep vehicle prior to migration date, AAMT/AAGS becomes the previous fund choices and BDPS becomes the current fund choice. 
•	For eligible BSA accounts that have ILAF or SGMT selected as their sweep vehicle prior to migration date, ILAF/SGMT becomes the previous fund choices and BDPS becomes the current fund choice.  As all eligible IRA accounts have ILAF as their sweep vehicle, ILAF will become the previous fund choice and BDPS becomes the current fund choice.
Note:  These accounts will be included in the new drain and fill process documented in section 6.0.
•	On the CPS A page, the history field should show AAMT or AAGS, respectively, as the prior sweep fund choice as of migration date for AAA accounts.
•	On the CPS U page, the history field should show ILAF or SGMT, respectively, as the prior sweep fund choice as of migration date for both BSA and IRA accounts.
•	On CPS, ‘BDPS’ will be the choice for accounts that migrate to BDP, and ‘BDPS’ should be allowed to be entered for new eligible AAA accounts on the A screen.
•	On CPS, ‘BDPS’ will be the choice for accounts that migrate to BDP, and ‘BDPS’ should be allowed to be entered for new eligible BSA accounts on the Universal fund selection screen and on the G2 screen for IRA accounts.
•	On the Merlin AAA fund choice screen, the Add fund drop down selection box should list ‘BDPS’ to represent the BDP program for eligible BDPS accounts. BDPS should be the first fund listed.
•	On the Merlin Universal Sweep Fund Choice screen, the Add fund drop down selection box should list ‘BDPS’ to represent the BDP program for eligible BSA accounts.  BDPS should be the first fund listed.
•	All eligible AAA accounts will not be allowed to manually purchase AAMT or AAGS.
•	All eligible BSA accounts will not be allowed to manually purchase ILAF or SGMT.
•	BDP eligible IRA accounts will continue to be able to manually purchase SGMT as part of their IRA portfolio.  IRA accounts ineligible for BDP will continue to have ILAF as their sweep vehicle and will continue to be able to purchase SGMT.  This is a re-statement of the functionality currently in place, and does not represent new functionality.

6.0	Sweep and Maintenance Process
6.1	Overview
During the drain and fill process, the drain on eligible accounts will be carried out by Universal Sweep (for BSA and IRA accounts) and AAA sweep (for AAA accounts), the fill will be carried out by BDP sweep.  Once the drain balance is depleted, eligible accounts that have migrated to BDPS or fund-switch into BDPS will have their BDP sweep debits and credits exercised wholly by the BDP sweep.  
There are no drain and fill processing changes for the following accounts:
•	AAA accounts ineligible for BDP that maintain AAMT or AAGS as their sweep choice.
•	BSA or IRA accounts ineligible for BDP that maintain ILAF or SGMT as their sweep choice.
•	AAA accounts that have AATF, AACT, AAIG, AAIF or AANY selected as their sweep vehicle.
•	BSA accounts that have CTFI, ITFI, or NTFI selected as their sweep vehicle.
•	AAA, BSA accounts that have no sweep election.
6.2	Pre-conditions
The drain/fill logic is applicable only for [ILAF and SGMT] for BSA and IRA accounts and [AAMT and AAGS] for AAA accounts. Other money market funds are listed here for reference.

6.3	Sweep Process 
The following outlines the sweep process for AAA, BSA and IRA accounts. As such, all the functionalities depicted below are in production. The following is for reference purposes.
 
Sweep process consists of the following 3 types of sweep.
6.3.1	Universal Sweep
Universal Sweep is responsible for sweeping funds for BSA, IRA accounts. This process must be enhanced to include Managed BSA, IRA accounts, Business BSA accounts and Personal Trust BSA, IRA accounts for BDP Phase 4.
6.3.1.1	Sweep Frequency
The sweep frequency for BSA accounts that have BDP as their sweep vehicle will be different from AAA accounts that have selected BDP.  For BSA accounts, sweep should take place daily if there is a cash balance > $999.99.  If the cash balance < = $999.99, sweep weekly on Monday nights.
Currently, for IRA accounts, sweep takes place daily if there is a cash balance > $0.00.  This will continue to be the case when the sweep choice is BDP.
Note that the sweep frequency will not change for those accounts that have one of the BSA tax free funds as their sweep vehicle, nor will it change for BSA accounts that are ineligible for BDP.
6.3.2	BDP Sweep
BDP sweep is responsible for sweeping funds into and out of BDP fund for BSA, IRA and AAA accounts. This process must be enhanced to accommodate sweep for Managed BSA, IRA, AAA accounts, Business BSA, AAA accounts and Personal Trust BSA, IRA, AAA accounts.
6.3.3	AAA Sweep
AAA sweep is responsible for sweeping funds into and out of AAA funds for AAA accounts. 
6.3.3.1	Sweep Frequency
The sweep frequency for BSA accounts that have BDP as their sweep vehicle will be different from AAA accounts that have selected BDP.  For AAA accounts, sweep takes place daily if there is a cash balance > $0.00.
6.3.4	Development and Deliverables
•	Enhance Universal, BDP and AAA sweep to recognize and sweep funds appropriately for Managed, Business and Personal Trust accounts.
•	AAA, BSA and IRA Tier Maintenance API needs to be updated to account for new product numbers (See page 38 for the complete list of product codes)
•	The new product codes will need to be provided to MV on the Maintenance and Daily Activity file.
•	For this phase, the drain/fill scenario for eligible Managed AAA, BSA, IRA, Business AAA, BSA and Personal Trust accounts will be identified when BDP is the current fund choice and current fund date = 9/17/07 and the prior fund choice is AAMT, AAGS, ILAF or SGMT. Currently, AAA drain/fill accounts are identified when BDP is the current fund choice and current fund date = 11/18/05 and the prior fund choice is AAMT or AAGS; BSA/IRA drain/fill accounts are identified when BDP is the current fund choice and current fund date = 9/18/06 and the prior fund choice is ILAF or SGMT.
•	Only Managed Business Accounts coded with Class/Sub-class 4N (Non Profit Corporation) are eligible of BDP Phase 4. Non-managed business accounts with class/sub-class 4N are already in the BDP program from the prior phase. These accounts must be assigned and processed as a Managed Account and NOT as a business managed account. Sweep must assign managed business accounts with 4N, product code of ‘009’ and NOT ‘007’; the reasons being these accounts are exempt from the Reserve Link rules. Hence, Metavante will process these accounts under product code ‘007’. Please refer to section 7.2 for the list of product codes.

6.4	Maintenance Process
Maintenance process currently runs at 7 am every business day. The purpose of maintenance process is to recognize changes involved in account maintenance (such as account closure, account upgrade/downgrade) and transmit the information to Metavante deposits system for processing.
6.4.1	Existing maintenance process
Maintenance process consists of:
1.	Account opening at Metavante – This is done when current fund choice is BDP and the plan number is blank. The logic used for account opening at Metavante will function exactly in a similar manner as it does for AAA, BSA and IRA accounts currently in production. Account opening is based on information from CPS.  
Notes:  
•	Once an account is opened, AAA provides a file to CPS that includes the plan number.
•	It is planned to have the available cash minimum for opening new non drain-fill AAA accounts will be lowered to be in line with the BSA/IRA requirement (> $0.00) prior to the migration of BSA BDP. 
•	Metavante will continue to receive the daily activity and maintenance files, represented by appropriate product codes as outlined in Section 7.2
2.	Account closing and re-opening at Metavante – This is done when an account switches out of BDP as the current fund choice into another non-BDP fund choice. This constitutes a full-sell of all BDP holdings and posting accrued interest to the account. This constitutes an account closure at Metavante. The existing rules for account closing and reopening at Metavante will follow the current process as it exists in production
3.	Swung accounts – When accounts swing from one office to another, necessary maintenance (close ‘swing from’ account and open ‘swing to’ account) records are sent to Metavante.
4.	Other Maintenance activities – such as single to joint ownership, FA number change, Product code change, interest tier change are also handled appropriately.
6.4.2	Enhancement required/Development/Deliverables
•	The Account Maintenance File sent to Metavante must handle more product codes as outlined in section 7.2.
•	In addition to the existing process, the maintenance process must be enhanced to add the following logic to support “Managed Account Terminations”.  Please refer to Appendix A for detailed use cases in support of this concept.
The business case – There should be no change in BDP rates and/or should not full-sell/buy back when a client changes from one managed product to another (such as Custom Portfolio to PPA).
Current process – A shift from one managed product to another entails a step down from Managed (custom portfolio) to non-managed status (trade control = 0 in CPS). The account is then upgraded to PPA.
The Challenge – A client’s intention to terminate a managed account permanently versus shifting to another managed product cannot be deciphered systematically as both these cases 	involve switching the account to non-managed status.
The solution – It has been decided that every client terminating the managed status will be assured the guaranteed 100% rate (AAMT or ILAF, depending on the account type) for 8 days from the termination date. If within 8 days, the client indeed shifts to another managed product, there will be no impact to his/her BDP positions i.e. (there will be no interest rate re-tier, no full-sell and no product code change). However, if after 8 days, the client still continues to be in a non-managed status, maintenance process will request (a) product code change, (b) interest rate change.
Notes: The process must consider additional parameters while evaluating accounts that require maintenance at Metavante. The parameters include (a) Trade Control Change, (b) Div-Handling change (c) Branch Office (for Personal Trust). Please refer to Appendix A for detailed use cases.
The logical design to implement the same is outlined below. Detailed technical specification is required to accomplish this task:
 
6.5	Margins Bucketing
The Margins bucketing in support of this phase will be exactly the same as the bucketing used to support AAA, BSA/IRA drain and fill sweep processing
6.6	Bank ID Value
The Bank ID value used in the header of the daily transaction file, weekly APY file, Bank Balance file and Daily Maintenance file needs to be parameterized by IFS and AAA so that any value can be used in QM testing or production.
7.0	Tier Maintenance
7.1	Overview
Managed AAA, BSA and IRA accounts that select BDP as their sweep choice will get an interest rate based on the managed or non-managed status.
This table represents the expected tiers that are required to support managed, business and personal trust accounts. Note: The table below represents the post-launch scenario; therefore the guaranteed rates for prior phases will have expired. (Interest plans 008, 009 and 308 are needed for purposes of keeping fund history.  
7.2	Product Codes at Metavante
New product codes should be setup on Metavante to support bank deposits for managed, business and personal trust accounts.  
  
 

* Note that the rates for tiers 005 and 006 will be entered systematically using a daily process.  Therefore these two tiers will not utilize the weekly manual entry process

Note that interest plan 180 through 189 will be reserved for up to 10 unique override rates for special situations. Interest Plan 180 is currently in use for a small group of accounts.

 

8.0	Workflow Processing
The workflows documented in this section detail the processes by which Managed accounts are opened, actions undertaken once opened, and closed.  While not every workflow results in development changes, the impact to and handling of accounts is important.
8.1	Opening a New Managed Account
8.1.1	Pre-conditions
User must have the appropriate access level to open a new account.
8.1.2	Use Case – CPS – Opening a New Managed (AAA) Account
Methodology: The following table outlines the account opening in detail. Screen Shots along with commentary are attached where needed.

Step #	Sending App/ Actor	Receiving App (if any)	Description	Outputs	Next Step
1	User	CPS	User logs on to CPS.	Access granted.	2
2	User	CPS	User enters ‘APAA’	User is taken to the APAA G1 screen.	3

Step 4: G1 Screen. The following screen outlines details when opening a Single Account with subclass Estate. Pressing Enter should proceed to G2 screen










Step 5: CStStep 5: G2 Screen. Change the trade-control from ‘0’ to ‘H’ (Pending Managed Account), assign ‘AAA Enroll’ to ‘r’, marking the account to type AAA. This should cause the Dividend Handling to change from ‘1’ to ‘3’ systematically.

Press enter to go to the ‘A’ screen.
 

 
Step 6: ‘A’ Screen The following screen must systematically, select ‘BDPS’ as the default fund choice when opening a managed account. The ‘Active Date’ must reflect the current date. In addition, prior fund choice, if any, must cascade in the sweep fund history table.

 

Edit Checks for CPS/Merlin: The appropriate edits must focus on the following fields in CPS. Please refer to Section 4.0 for detailed account eligibility.
1.	Trade Control
2.	Div Handling Code
3.	Status
4.	Class
5.	Sub-Class

Managed BSA
Business BSA	BDPS, ITFI, CTFI, NTFI	ILAF, SGMT, ABFS
Managed IRA	BDPS	ILAF, ABFS

8.1.3	Exceptions to this work flow

1.	Can a Trade-control be set to any value to reflect Managed Account status (D, J, K, L etc). Please look at screen shots below. What does this mean?
Answer/Analysis: Selected users are privileged to perform this operation in CPS. The primary business reason for this action is to speed up the process of changing the trade control to ‘0’ so FA’s can quickly operate the account to realize market synergies. However, prior to such alterations, the appropriate personnel always ensures the account is ‘terminated’ of the managed status using Managed Accounts platform (IACA, Advisor One, Boss etc). This will ensure the account is out of managed space. 
  
 
8.1.4	Alternative Flows – Merlin
Step #	Sending App/ Actor	Receiving App (if any)	Description	Outputs	Next Step
1	User	Merlin	User logs on to Merlin.	Access granted.	2
2	User	CPS	User enters ‘personal information’ as a part of the new account opening process	User is taken to the APAA G1 screen.	3
Step 3: The following screen shot in Merlin must undergo changes to include BDPS as the default fund choice and block AAMT.

 
8.1.5	Use Case Notes & Comments
•	Step 3 - Under the current CPS process, the user needs to first elect to have a sweep then pick the sweep fund.
•	The same information should appear in CPS regardless of whether the account is opened using CPS or Merlin.
8.1.6	Post-conditions
•	The account is opened on CPS/Merlin.
8.1.7	Development/Deliverables
1.	Managed AAA, BSA and IRA accounts should be defaulted to ‘BDPS’ as the fund choice in both CPS and Merlin.
2.	For Trade-control = ‘H’, ‘BDPS’ should be the default fund choice in CPS/Merlin.
8.1.8	Additional Information
Non-Functional Requirements	•	None
Business Rules
	•	All existing rules for using CPS apply (i.e., minimum data requirements, data formats, etc. ) 
8.2	Incepting a New Managed Account
8.2.1	Pre-conditions
User must have the appropriate access level to incept a new account.
Account should have been created in CPS/Merlin.
8.2.2	Use Case – SMA – Incepting a New Managed (AAA) Account
The following diagram is a pictorial depiction of SMA inception process:

Portfolio Architect	Incept without positions-same day trading possible	Real-time

8.2.3	Exceptions to this workflow
MFA process – ‘B’ to ‘D’ conversion: This process is no longer an issue for BDP Phase 4. This feature will be disabled in production prior to BDP launch date of 9/17/07.
8.2.4	Alternative Flows – CPS
No changes are required in CPS to incept the account. The process to change the trade-control to appropriate managed status must remain the same.
8.2.5	Alternative Flows – Merlin
Not Applicable
8.2.6	Use Case Notes & Comments
•	See table in 9.2.2
8.2.7	Post-conditions
•	The trade control in CPS/Merlin should be the same as updated by SMA.
8.2.8	Development/Deliverables
1.	CPS: Managed AAA, BSA and IRA accounts should be defaulted to ‘BDPS’ as the fund choice in both CPS and Merlin.
2.	Edit Checks for SMA and MFA: Managed accounts should allow for BDPS as the default fund choice while incepting accounts. 
3.	MFA (Mutual Fund Advisory) Process: For Fund solutions and Portfolio Architect products only, Money market fund choices are selected in the Advisor One process. As a part of the account opening process, the fund choice is selected in CPS and currently there is an ability to override this selection in the Advisor one platform. This process must be changed and the ability to select funds through Advisor One must be disabled. Once this change is implemented, MFA products will be in sync with other managed products.
4.	MFA Process: MFA should NOT sell money market positions explicitly to offset the quarterly billing amount. AAA sweep should handle this as a part of the sweep process. No build is necessary for AAA sweep to accommodate this process.

8.2.9	Additional Information
Non-Functional Requirements	•	None
Business Rules	•	All existing rules for using CPS apply (i.e., minimum data requirements, data formats, etc. ) 
8.3	Switching from Managed to Non-Managed Account/Termination of managed status
8.3.1	Pre-conditions
The account must be a managed account. 
Based on discussions, a managed account can be stripped off the managed status only via SMA platform.

1	User	SMA (advisor One)	User logs on to SMA.	Access granted.	2
2	User	SMA	User selects Advisor One platform link from Ideas page	User is taken into Advisor One platform	3
3	User	SMA	User inputs the office and FA number and selects ‘Account Review and Servicing’ and clicks next button. 	User is taken to ‘LYDIA main menu’	4
4	User	SMA	User clicks ‘Action Items’ from the web page
	User is taken to the Action Items page.	5
5	User	SMA	User clicks ‘Terminate Account’ option	Terminate account web page show up	6

Step 6: User enters the Account number and selects one of the liquidation options as outlined in the below screen. 
 
Step7: Selecting ‘All Holdings’ will display the following page for Termination.


 
This will terminate an account to a Non-Managed status. At this point in time, the Trade Control in CPS is changed from a valid managed trade control to ‘0’ (Non Managed Status). Please note that there is no work involved for CPS/Merlin here.
The above mentioned use-case will convert the following Managed account to a Non-managed status.
1.	Managed AAA to AAA
2.	Managed BSA to BSA
3.	Managed IRA to IRA
The following cases/workflows will require additional steps in addition to the above mentioned use-case:
Scenarios	Intermediate Results	Additional workflow	Final Result
Managed AAA to BSA	The above workflow will change the account to AAA	User must change the Div-Handling code in CPS from ‘3’ to ‘1’. This is done is Melvin Rodriguez area.	The account is changed to BSA
Managed BSA to AAA	The above workflow will change the account to BSA	User must change the Div-Handling code in CPS from ‘1’ to ‘3’. This is done at the branch level. 	The account is changed to AAA

8.3.3	Exceptions to this workflow
•	What happens when users change the trade control in CPS directly without the use of Advisor One? Is this possible? If so, what are the implications?
Answer/Analysis: Selected users are privileged to perform this operation in CPS. The primary business reason for this action is to speed up the process of changing the trade control to ‘0’ so FA’s can quickly operate the account to realize market synergies. However, prior to such alterations, the appropriate personnel always ensures the account is ‘terminated’ of the managed status using Managed Accounts platform (IACA, Advisor One, Boss etc). This will ensure the account is out of managed space.
•	In some cases, managed accounts once downgraded to non-managed status undergo manual intervention to change the account to BSA. Need more clarification and its effect on BDP.
8.3.4	Alternative Flows
Not possible in Merlin.
8.3.5	Use Case Notes & Comments
•	There is no change to this workflow process. This is for informational purposes only.
•	The Termination option will not trigger a sell/buy of money market funds through the managed accounts system.
•	There is a 3 day lag period prior to upgrading this account again to a managed status.
8.3.6	Post-conditions
CPS should reflect the changed trade control ‘0’. 
8.3.7	Development/Deliverables
This should trigger the maintenance and sweep processes by AAA sweep by reading the CPS activity file. Please see Appendix A for the details

Step 3: G2 Screen – User enters the account number and navigates to G2 Screen. Currently, a non-managed account with BDPS as the current fund choice is prohibited from changing the trade control to ‘H’ (pending managed). G2 should change to allow BDPS for ‘H’ trade control. Please see the following screenshot.
 
Step 4: Please refer to section 8.2 for the next steps
The above mentioned use-case will convert the following Non-Managed account to a Managed status.
1.	AAA to Managed AAA
2.	BSA to Managed BSA
3.	IRA to Managed IRA
The following cases/workflows will require additional steps in addition to the above mentioned use-case:
Scenarios	Additional workflow	Intermediate Results	Final Result
BSA to Managed AAA	User must change the Div-Handling code in CPS from ‘0’ to ‘3’.	The account is now AAA	Upon executing the above workflow, the account is converted from AAA to Managed AAA
AAA to Managed BSA	User must change the Div-Handling code in CPS from ‘3’ to ‘0’.	The account is now BSA	Upon executing the above workflow, the account is converted from AAA to Managed BSA

8.4.3	Alternative Flows
Alternatively, Non-Managed account could be incepted as a Managed account even if the trade control is ‘0’ in CPS. Thus, steps 1, 2 and 3 in the section 8.4.2 (use case) are NOT pre-requisites to this workflow.

9.0	Personal Trust Accounts
9.1	Overview:
Personal Trust accounts are setup in GWM universe. Personal Trust accounting and record keeping functions are outsourced to Metavante, a third party vendor.
9.2	Highlights: 
1.	Personal Trust Accounts in the GWM world can be (a) Managed (b) Non-Managed set of accounts.
2.	Personal Trust Accounts (from a Trust perspective) is set up either as a Discretionary (Firm’s fiduciary responsibility towards the client) or Non-Discretionary type. 
3.	Thus, the following combinations are possible/exist today: 
a.	A personal trust Managed Account that is discretionary in nature 
b.	A personal trust Non-Managed Account that is discretionary in nature 
c.	A personal trust Managed Account that is Non-discretionary in nature 
d.	A personal trust Non-Managed Account that is Non-discretionary in nature 

9.3	Account recognition: 
The following outlines how to decipher systematically between Managed/Discretionary for personal accounts.

1.	Only the following Branch/Office are allowed to setup Personal Trust Accounts (No known exceptions to this rule so far). For the purposes of this phase, Personal Trust accounts must be identified solely by referencing the below mentioned branch numbers. 
Following is the list of Morgan Stanley Trust branches:
                        755    Currently in use
534    Currently in use
558    Currently in use
546    Currently in use 
566    Reserved for future use
568    Reserved for future use
583	Reserved for future use

2.	As a part of the account set up process, FA’s must select Trust-type. If trust-type ‘DWTCDS’ is selected, then it’s a discretionary account. Please note that behind the scenes, this translates into Account Class = 9 and Sub-class = ‘1’ combination in CPS. 
3.	Alternatively, if trust-type ‘DWTCDR’ is selected, then it’s a Non-discretionary account. Please note that behind the scenes, this translates into Account Class = 9 and Sub-class = ‘0’ combination in CPS. 
10.0	Statements
10.1	Overview:
Statements must be enhanced to display BDP related activities for managed AAA, BSA, IRA accounts and business AAA, BSA accounts.
Discover Bank will be replaced by Morgan Stanley Trust FSB for this phase. Please refer to Section 2.0 for the bank related details.
There may be circumstances where Statements will be required to display all the three banks namely ‘Morgan Stanley Bank’, ‘Morgan Stanley Trust FSB’ and ‘Discover Bank’. This situation may arise when an account switches to managed status post BDP launch. This will result in moving assets from ‘Discover Bank’ to ‘Morgan Stanley Trust FSB’ on the upgrade date and will be followed by interest receipt from ‘Discover Bank’ on the second last business day of the month.
10.2	Development and Deliverables:
10.2.1	BDP Holdings display 
Wherever it appears on a monthly statement, the holdings should read as follows:
‘Morgan Stanley Bank’
‘Morgan Stanley Trust’
	‘Discover Bank’ (if required)
10.2.2	Other changes
The following screen shot outlines changes required:

•	The bank names and their holdings in each bank must be specified.
•	Where required, all the three banks along with corresponding holdings should be displayed.
•	The Disclosure on AAA statements in the Asset Details section will read as follows “Bank deposits are at Morgan Stanley Bank and Morgan Stanley Trust (Members FDIC), affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.  Bank deposits are eligible for FDIC insurance up to applicable limits.  Not SIPC insured.”
•	For all BDP eligible accounts, a second disclosure will appear on the statement backer as follows: “The Bank Deposit Program APY represents the applicable rate in effect for your deposits at the statement ending date.  This APY may be different than the APY that was in effect during the statement period.  For current Bank Deposit Program or Money Market Fund yields, go to http://www.morganstanleyindividual.com/xxxx/xxxx.” 
•	Est Yrly Income must be displayed in statements. The formula to derive the value is Est Yrly Income = (Total Bank Deposits * APY)
•	Business AAA – These statements follow the same bank deposit presentation and disclosure that is used for non-business AAA.
•	Business BSA – These statements follow the same bank deposit presentation and disclosure that is used for non-business BSA.
•	Personal Trust statements are serviced by a third party vendor and no changes are required to GWM statements.

“Rates are posted each Tuesday, except when the Federal Reserve Bank or New York Stock Exchange are closed. In that case, rates will be posted on the next business day.
If ILAF (or SGMT) is your cash sweep investment as of September 2006, the rate paid on your bank deposits on the Effective Date will be set periodically, for a period of not less than 6 months, at the higher of the iMoneyNet Retail Taxable Money Market Index (or the iMoneyNet Government Retail Taxable Money Market Index) or 90% of the prevailing ILAF (or SGMT) rate. The Bank Deposit Program rate is calculated on a weekly basis, based on the ILAF/SGMT 7-day yield from the previous week.

17.0	Data Services, Mutual Funds, Sweep Requirements for Tier Maintenance
17.1	Overview:
Managed AAA, BSA and IRA accounts that select BDP as their sweep choice will get an interest rate based on the managed or non-managed status.
This table represents the expected tiers that are required to support managed, business and personal trust accounts. Note: The table below represents the post-launch scenario; therefore the guaranteed rates for prior phases will have expired. (Interest plans 008, 009 and 308 are needed for purposes of keeping fund history. 

17.2	Development/Deliverables:
#	Deliverables	Systems Impacted
1	New and existing managed accounts will receive the 100% AAMT or ILAF rate in perpetuity depending on whether the account is a AAA or BSA/IRA/CESA	Data Services
Sweep
2	The 100% AAMT and 100% ILAF rate should be set daily to be equal to the prior day’s AAMT/ILAF daily yield.  This should be done systematically	Data Services
Mutual Fund Services
3	When the account is a Trade Control H (has been opened but not incepted) it should receive the regular account (non-managed) tiered rates. Once incepted, the account should be immediately changed to the managed account BDP pricing i.e. Sweep team should send (a) interest tier maintenance record and (b) product code change record upon changing the account to a managed status. 	Data Services
Sweep
4	Existing business accounts to receive 90% of prior MMF for at least 6 months with tiered rates thereafter	Data Services
Sweep
5	The tiered rate for business accounts will be based on household assets but the household assets calculation for the business account only should exclude the assets of any Individual Retirement Accounts in the household.  As an example, a business account householded with an active assets account and an individual retirement account would exclude the IRA’s assets in the household calculation to determine the BDP tier for the business account.  
The household calculation to determine the BDP tier for the IRA and the active assets account will use the same methodology as prior phases (no change).	Data Services
6	New business accounts to receive the tiered rate starting when the account is opened	Data Services
7	Guaranteed interest rates will be set using the same weekly process as in prior phases
	Data Services
8	Tiered interest rates will be set weekly, using the same process as in prior phases. 	Data Services
9	Any new or existing business accounts that are managed will receive the managed account pricing	Data Services
10	Personal Trust accounts will be identified as accounts that have a class of 9 and either a sub-class of 0 and 1	Data Services
11	New and existing personal trust accounts will receive the 100% AAMT or ILAF rate in perpetuity depending on whether the account is a AAA or BSA/IRA	Data Services
12	Similar to managed accounts, the 100% AAMT and 100% ILAF rate should be set daily to be equal to the prior day’s AAMT/ILAF daily yield.  This should be done systematically and not require rates to be entered manually.	Mutual Funds
13	To support reporting process, Morgan Stanley should transmit the ‘opening fed funds rate’ to Metavante on a daily basis. Preferably, this must be in the same file as daily AAMT/ILAF rates.
Opening fed funds rate are transmitted from ISG daily around 2 pm EST. The file name is ‘PMGS.NDM.MORGAN.INT.RATE (0). Look for the literals ‘opening fed fund rt’ to pick up the corresponding rate.
Margins upload the same information to a DB2 table ‘MGS_INT_BASE’ soon after the file received. 
Preferably, Mutual funds should transmit the AAMT, ILAF and the ‘Opening Fed Funds Rate’ in the same file to Metavante daily before 10 pm EST
	Mutual Funds 

18.0	Margins

All processes to support BDP Phase 4 in terms of Journals, Bucket movements to track BDP numbers must continue to function as in prior phases.

18.1	Development/Deliverables:
In addition to the Margin master file that is sent to Metavante personal trust, Margins should send the daily ‘Bank Balance File’ to Metavante personal trust. The file should preferably be sent in the same time frame as the margin master. The file should contain data pertaining only to the personal trust offices. 

Following is the list of Morgan Stanley Trust branches:
                        755    Currently in use
534    Currently in use
558    Currently in use
546    Currently in use 
566    Reserved for future use
568    Reserved for future use
584	Reserved for future use

Margins to calculate Est Yrly Income and feed to statements in the existing file. The formula to derive the value is Est Yrly Income = (Total Bank Deposits * APY). The value must be rounded to the nearest dollar.




19.0	Performance Reporting
Performance Reporting produces monthly and quarterly reports for managed accounts. All underlying BDP security positions are rolled into the 360 security on RTA. 


19.1	Development/Deliverables:
1. Interest for BDP securities flow in on transactions for 361, 364, 368 securities. Tests for the security identifiers are hard coded, so as securities are added changes need to be made. 

		2. Change Quarterly Performance Reports, PAD Report  



20.0	Client Mailings

All BDP eligible AAA, BSA and IRA (managed, business and personal trust) accounts must receive a letter informing them of the change in their sweep fund choices.  These accounts must receive the notification letter, even if the account is BDP-eligible but is currently out of scope for the migration (i.e., currently have a tax free fund selected), the account must receive the notification letter.
A detailed document will be published outlining the Client Mailing letter.
